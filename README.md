# clean_code_assignment

## This project is to implement a java programme to find maximum and minimum number from a given list. This project has a Class **MinMaxFinder** which contains a static class **MinMax** to hold the minimum and maximum number


### This project is done to implement clean code practices hence the following steps are taken care in this programme.

1. Variarble name , method name and class name are used appropriate to the programme

2. **Camel case** is used for naming variables and methods.

3. **Pascal case** is used for naming classes.
  
4. **Indundation** foramtting is placed according to convention.

5. **Comments** are added for better understanding of code.

6. Proper **packaging** is done in this programme.

The class **MinMaxFinder** contains a method **maximumMinimum()** which returns an instance of Static class **MinMax** which will contain the miminum and maximum numbers.
The static class **MinMax** contains 2 variables ***minimumNumber*** and ***maximumNumber***
